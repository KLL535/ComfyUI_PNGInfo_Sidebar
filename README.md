# ComfyUI_PNGInfo_Sidebar

### Description:
ComfyUI custom frontend extension that adds a sidebar for easy viewing of PNG file metadata.

### Why is this needed:
If you have a lot of images generated in **Forge**, you switched to **СomfyUI**, and you really miss the **PNGInfo tab**, then this extension will help you.
The extension adds a tab on the left, which, when opened, will open a convenient window for viewing PNG image metadata.
Just click on the button/image and open the image. Or drag the image to this part of the window to open it.

### Advantages:
Allows you to conveniently view information without stopping the workflow.

### Disadvantages:
- The extension can only read PNG files so far.
- Metadata created by **Forge** and **СomfyUI** is supported, but opening files saved by standard **СomfyUI** tools may cause problems due to **СomfyUI** specific approach to storing information.
